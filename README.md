# algorithms-kotlin
This repo is used to reproduce examples from **"Algorithms Unlocked"** and **"Introduction to Algorithms"** by **Thomas H. Cormen**.

All the examples are **written in Kotlin**. The main purpose is to get used to the language while studying algorithms, and also to create more Kotlin examples in order to make the language popular.

Feel free to contribute, knowledge is built together.

* [Algorithms Unlocked](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Unlocked-Press-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262518805) -  Readers will learn what computer algorithms are, how to describe them, and how to evaluate them. They will discover simple ways to search for information in a computer; methods for rearranging information in a computer into a prescribed order ("sorting"); how to solve basic problems that can be modeled in a computer with a mathematical structure called a "graph" (useful for modeling road networks, dependencies among tasks, and financial relationships); how to solve problems that ask questions about strings of characters such as DNA structures; the basic principles behind cryptography; fundamentals of data compression; and even that there are some problems that no one has figured out how to solve on a computer in a reasonable amount of time.

* [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844) - Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.
